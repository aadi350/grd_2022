This GitHub serves as the home directory for our submission to the GRD2022 challenge

This is organised into cleaning, feature-building and training. 
### Data Loading
We loaded our data from Google Earth Engine in the [https://github.com/aadi350/grd_2022/blob/main/src/pull_ee.py](pull_ee.py) 

### Cleaning and Feature Engineering
This was done in a series of notebooks in the `src/features` folder.

### Modeling
Finally, our machine learning algorithm (an ensemble of Neural-Networks) was trained and evaluated using scripts in `src/models`

### Interactive Front-End
- TODO
